# Ottoman Sarki Project

This is a repository of pre-WWI Ottoman music from a publication entitled "Chants Turcs" published in Istanbul. This repo is a part of a project at MIT to encode the music in order to analyze this repertoire.

Currently (Spring 2023), as part of the  MIT Digital Humanities Lab, we are completing proofreading all files and saving them as MuseScore files as well as .musicxml files. Files that we are confident about are in the Corrected Verions folder, files in which the notation is unclear are located in the Questionable Scores folder.
