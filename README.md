# Ottoman Sarki Project

This is a repository of pre-WWI Ottoman music from a publication entitled "Chants Turcs" published in Istanbul, as a part of a project at MIT to create encodings and analyses of this repertoire.

As of the end of Spring 2021, MusicXML files of all the music available for computational analysis.

In Spring 2023, in collaboration with the MIT DH Lab, we intend to create methods to identify the mode of each of the pieces in this corpus.
